# Installation
This is where you list the necessary libraries, languages and packages that are required.  
The general structure is listing IDE/code-editor and language, dependencies and then general installation (e.g. cloning the repo/specialised instructions that is required for each contributor). 

- The IDE/code-editor and language needed, if not already installed.
- Install SciPy
` C:\Users\Rajani>pip install scipy
`
- Clone the repo
`git clone https://github.com/vishraj12/test-repo.git`
