## File Structure
Dataset, CAA, CAA Analysis.

## Architectural Diagram 
Visual representation of all project components and their interactions. 

## Timeline
Assuming the project has a proposed timeline, the milestones should be stated with the dates by which they are supposed to be completed. 

August - October 2025:
- Literature Review
- Familiarize with different types of sycophantic behaviors/Datasets
- Understanding how to use NNsight/HookedTransformers/Pytorch to steer, store activation, ablate, path patching
- Replicate code and familiarize with causal path patching code from paper to find attention heads.
  
November - December 2025:
- Design and test probes on attention heads output and residual stream activations
- Verify using ablation, steering, and high to low dimensional graphing methods 
- Use and test LLM as a judge as a way to easily reproducible evaluation of sycophancy in model.
  
January-February 2026:
- If linear direction found:
  - Continue onto use Concept Cones to show multi-dimensional subspace encodes sycophantic behaviors. 
  - Implement reFAT for design for sycophantic behavior, ablating direction along which non-sycophantic behavior occurs and finetune the model. 
  - Extend to different model families
 
February - March 2024:
- Try and see if there are subcategories of sycophancy that exist by clustering methods like UMAP/PCA/tSNE
- Try and see if we can induce sycophancy by cross-model steering or induce sycophancy by getting it in a fine tuned version and cross-model steering to a non-fine tuned version. 

March - April 2024:
- Project Documentation and Report Writing
- Final Presentation and Demo
